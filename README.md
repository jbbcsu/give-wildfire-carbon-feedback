# GIVE precipitation and hydrologic-damages extension

This directory is a standalone research/implementation track for adding the
marginal damages of CO2-induced precipitation change to GIVE's social cost of
carbon (SCC).  It does not modify or import any wildfire/biomass-burning work.
The files here are specifications and an unintegrated component interface;
they are intentionally not wired into the baseline model.

## Current boundary

The first build prioritizes **global agricultural damages from precipitation
patterns**—seasonality, timing, dry spells, wet-day frequency, and extremes—in
a joint temperature--precipitation response. Coastal storm-surge and
sea-level-rise costs remain the responsibility of CIAM. Inland flood/built
infrastructure is a secondary, separately accounted track. Agricultural
damages must replace, not be added to, the current temperature-only MooreAg
sector.

See [PLAN.md](PLAN.md) for the phased protocol, [SOURCES.md](SOURCES.md) for
authoritative inputs, and [src/PrecipitationDamages.jl](src/PrecipitationDamages.jl)
for the isolated Mimi component contract.  The literature-first recommendation
and ML contingency are in [AGRICULTURE_RESEARCH.md](AGRICULTURE_RESEARCH.md).
The evidence-bounded manuscript and Methods/SI blueprints are in
[MANUSCRIPT_OUTLINE.md](MANUSCRIPT_OUTLINE.md) and
[METHODS_SI_OUTLINE.md](METHODS_SI_OUTLINE.md).
