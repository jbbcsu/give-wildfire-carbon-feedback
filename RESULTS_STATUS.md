# Analysis status and claim ledger

Updated: 2026-08-17. This file records completed computational milestones; it
does not report final response estimates or SCC values.

## Completed empirical checks

The pilot produced 5,488 crop-year feature rows, had no duplicate crop-year
grid keys, and passed nonnegative precipitation and stage-to-season
reconciliation checks. The exact ISIMIP/GDHY coordinate conversion was
validated; 43.4% of potential calendar cells in this pilot had an observed
GDHY yield. That coverage rate is a data-support diagnostic, not a global
agricultural coverage estimate.

The fixed-effects pilot fit exists only to test panel dimensionality and
numerical conditioning. Its coefficients and in-sample fit are not reported
in the manuscript and are prohibited from SCC integration by the validation
protocol.

The global maize/rainfed panel passed the same coordinate and uniqueness
checks and supported a scalable two-way within-estimator run. The three-window
stage panel has 1,618,080 rows and exactly reconciles to all 539,360
season-level records in crop-year days, wet-day counts, and maximum daily
rainfall; the largest precipitation-sum difference is 0.000855 mm from stored
floating-point precision. A stage-resolved fixed-effects diagnostic also ran
on the 120,325 observed-yield rows. Its numerical estimates remain
diagnostic-only and are not reported or used as SCC inputs.

On 2026-08-17 the maize outcome join was changed from the undocumented
convenience `maize` directory to the documented season-specific `maize_major`
directory. This gives 120,325 observed rows and is the only permitted
maize-pilot outcome mapping going forward; the crosswalk and its limitation
for second maize seasons are recorded in `data/provenance/`.

This does not clear the main-analysis gate: crop-specific phenology, remaining
crops/years, `tasmin` and final heat features, pre-specified holdouts,
uncertainty, CO2 treatment, adaptation estimation, welfare translation, and
matched future baseline/pulse paths remain outstanding.
